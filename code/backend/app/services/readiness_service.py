# ==========================================================
# READINESS SERVICE
# PHASE 7C.7f
# ==========================================================
#
# LIVENESS vs READINESS
# ----------------------------------------------------------
#
# GET /health
#
#     Process liveness only.
#
#     Deliberately dependency-free so an orchestrator never
#     restarts a healthy process just because PostgreSQL is
#     briefly unreachable.
#
#
# GET /health/ready
#
#     Dependency-aware readiness.
#
#     Answers a different question:
#
#         "can this process actually serve the document
#          workflows right now?"
#
#
# COST BOUNDARY
# ----------------------------------------------------------
#
# Readiness must be fast and deterministic.
#
# It therefore NEVER runs:
#
#     PaddleOCR inference
#     Groq / LLM inference
#
# External OCR and LLM availability is represented through
# application-service initialization, because the pipeline
# service constructs its OCR and extraction clients during
# application startup.
#
#
# INFORMATION BOUNDARY
# ----------------------------------------------------------
#
# A failed check reports only:
#
#     a stable reason code
#     the exception class name
#
# It never reports str(exception).
#
# SQLAlchemy connection errors routinely embed the full
# database URL, including the password, in their message.
# Those must never reach an HTTP response or a log field.

# "pipeline" is a LazyPipeline holder, and what its presence
# proves changed in Phase 9.5.
#
# It used to be the constructed DocumentPipelineService, so its
# presence transitively meant the OCR models had loaded. Now
# the API builds them on first use of the synchronous analyze
# route, because in the async architecture the API never runs
# OCR -- the worker does -- and loading the models cost 1.7
# seconds of startup and a few hundred megabytes in every API
# replica for a compatibility endpoint.
#
# So this check now means "the holder is wired up", which is
# the honest claim. Whether the models are loaded is reported
# separately by pipeline_loaded below and is deliberately NOT
# required: an API that has not yet needed a pipeline is ready
# to do everything it is for.
#
# OCR readiness belongs to the worker process, which cannot
# start without it.
